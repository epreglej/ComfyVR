Comfy VR is currently hosted on: [comfy-vr.tech](https://comfy-vr.tech)  
*(Data might not be accessible if the database went into automatic sleep mode due to resource saving mode)*

This web application was developed during the process of trying to figure out what a good VR comfort, accessibility and safety ranking system would look like.

## Used technologies
- **Nuxt** (frontend and backend based on Vue and NitroJS frameworks)
- **Supabase** (remote database using a free tier subscription)
- **BeerCSS** (CSS framework inspired by Material 3 design)

## Usage example
