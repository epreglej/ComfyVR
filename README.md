*(Data might not be accessible if the database went into automatic sleep mode due to resource usage.)*

This web application was developed in the process of trying to figure out what a good VR comfort, accessibility, and security system would look like.

## Used technologies
- **Nuxt** (frontend and backend based on Vue and NitroJS frameworks)
- **Supabase** (remote database using a free tier subscription)
- **BeerCSS** (CSS framework inspired by Material 3 design)

## Usage example
